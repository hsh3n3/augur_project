For this project we are creating an API endpoint that returns useful data from repo_dependencies table. 
For sprint 1 we created 4 queries that pulled pull data from repo_dependencies.
While this is the number of queries that Proffesor Goggins advised, we may increase the number or complexity of these queries if nessecary in the future.
Additionally, the scope of this project may widen to include multiple API's or pull data from multiple tables as we become more accustomed to the 
actual implementation of the code.
